# Computer Vision Projects with Python 3 [Video]
This is the code repository for [Computer Vision Projects with Python 3 [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/computer-vision-projects-python-3-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788835565), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
The Python programming language is an ideal platform for rapidly prototyping and developing production-grade codes for image processing and computer vision with its robust syntax and wealth of powerful libraries.

This video course will start by showing you how to set up Anaconda Python for the major OSes with cutting-edge third-party libraries for computer vision. You’ll learn state-of-the-art techniques to classify images and find and identify humans within videos.

Next, you’ll understand how to set up Anaconda Python 3 for the major OSes (Windows, Mac, and Linux) and augment it with the powerful vision and machine learning tools OpenCV and TensorFlow, as well as Dlib. You’ll be taken through the handwritten digits classifier and then move on to detecting facial features and finally develop a general image classifier.

By the end of this course, you’ll know the basic tools of computer vision and be able to put it into practice.
